"Would you like to copy the first UV channel..."
	This will copy the mapping on the first UV channel overwriting the second
	for all geometry objects

"Would you like to use explicit normals..."
	This will use the normal vectors of the model, instead of recalculating
	vectors based on the surrounding faces
